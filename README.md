# Design-of-Sewer-System
Project in EPA SWMM

•	The main objective of this project is the improvement of surrounding area environment and
prevention of flooding and preservation of water quality in public water bodies by separating
sewage from environment
•	Major role of the system is:
  	Improvement in the environment by removing the sewage as it originates
  	Preventing inundation of low lying areas that may be otherwise caused by not sewering.
  	Prevention of vector propagation by sluggish sewage stagnations
  	Avoiding cross connections with fresh water sources by seepage
•	The Cost estimation has also been done
